# Freedom Cash
[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) love [Freedom Cash](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x1Dc4E031e7737455318C77f7515F8Ea8bE280a93) as one of many potential journeys into freedom.   

## Incentive Goals 
[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) foster ever emerging architectures of freedom by rewarding those who help themselves and others to be free.    

Some of our specific incentive goals are: 

1. Broad Distribution / Decentralization   
2. Liquidity Provisioning    
3. Education & Exploration   

We might publish corresponding reward smart contracts like [this one](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xf1497128cdB01FbF249e413Bf633125d807Cfdb4) for each incentive goal.

[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) hope these experiments help to make crypto cypherpunk again.  

## Initial Distribution
The initial distribution plays with Proof of Respect based, Proof of Hike based and Proof of Liquidity Provider based rewards.    

[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) play with accounts which nobody is interested in atm of writing this. We might start promoting accounts like [this](https://rumble.com/c/c-5722872/videos) or [that](https://twitter.com/MoniqueBau23778) when the time is right.   
Those accounts inspired [Friends Of Satoshi](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi). This is why [we](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) reward [Geo Cachers](http://geo-caching.org) who prepare such accounts. We trust them to support us in perfect initial distributions and ongoing distributions - e.g. by providing FREE/Matic Liquidity. This shall increase the likelyhood that [FREE](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x1dc4e031e7737455318c77f7515f8ea8be280a93#tokentxns) flows to those who deserve it most. 
  
We foster [self hosted wallet generation](https://moniquebaumann.github.io/paperwallet-generator) and the publishing of corresponding [Geo-Caching](https://geo-caching.org) [videos](https://rumble.com/c/c-5722872/videos) for each generated [Freedom Cash Wallet](https://moniquebaumann.github.io/paperwallet-generator) via [rumble.com](https://rumble.com) to plant the seeds and to foster many decentralized grassroot movements around [Freedom Cash](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x1dc4e031e7737455318c77f7515f8ea8be280a93#code).
