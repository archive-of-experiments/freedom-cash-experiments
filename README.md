# Freedom Cash
[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) love [Freedom Cash](https://polygonscan.com/token/) as one of many potential journeys into freedom.   

We combine crypto education with [Geo-Caching](https://geo-caching.org).   

## Initial Distribution
The initial distribution plays with Proof of Hike based and Proof of Liquidity Provider based [rewards](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x66e5567fc9be455febde6c3538ce5a100a15a606).    

[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) play with accounts which nobody is interested in atm of writing this. We might start promoting such accounts like [this](https://rumble.com/c/c-5722872/videos) or [that](https://twitter.com/MoniqueBau23778) when the time is right.   
Those accounts inspired [Friends Of Satoshi](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi). This is why [we](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) have prepared many of them.  
  
We tend to publish at least 126.000 [Geo-Caching](https://geo-caching.org) [videos](https://rumble.com/c/c-5722872/videos) via those accounts until 30.8.2024.  


## Incentive Goals 
[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) foster ever emerging architectures of freedom by rewarding those who help themselves and others to be free.    

Some of our specific incentive goals are: 

1. Broad Distribution / Decentralization   
2. Liquidity Provisioning    
3. Education & Exploration   

We might publish corresponding reward smart contracts like [this one](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xf1497128cdB01FbF249e413Bf633125d807Cfdb4) for each incentive goal.

[We](https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi) hope these experiments help to make crypto cypherpunk again.  
We are free.
